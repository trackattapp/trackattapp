This is an app that we did for ourselves. We were not that sure we were using our time
as we thought we were. You often hear that you should track your time, but it is a pain
to do it. So we made this app to make it easier for us. We hope it helps you too.

We tried to make it as simple as we could think of. You just have to define the categories
you want to track, and then the app will record the time you spend on each category. Then
you can see the results in a pie chart. You can also see the results of previous days.

As soon as the App is on, you will see the Start and Stop Recording buttons. Those are
self explainatory. The
pie chart will start updating in real time. The home icon will take you to the folder 
where the data is being
saved, so you can use it for your own analysis. The camera icon, will save the current pie
chart as a .png in the same folder. Instead, the update icon, will load the changes you have 
made in the tags_and_keywords.txt file, without having to restart the app.


The choice of the logo is not random. We thought of attention as a drop of water, and
whatever you want to become or to achieve as an ocean, that you can achieve only drop by
drop. So we thought of the app as a way to help you see how you are spending your drops
of attention, so you can make sure you are using them to build the ocean you want.
