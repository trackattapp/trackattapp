This is an app that we built to help ourselves. 
We were not that sure we were using our time as we thought we were, 
and you often hear that you can only improve what you can measure. 
You should track your time if you want to improve your productivity, 
but in practice, it is a pain to do it. 
So we made this app to make it easier for us. We hope it helps you too.

Also, in times where every company is trying 
to conquer your attention and reduce to zero your productivity,
it's good to have a tool to fight back. Our goal is not only to
help you track how you spend your attention, but also to help 
you train your tenacity, help you train your capacity to stick 
to what you want to do.


<br>

The choice of the logo is not random. We thought of attention as a drop of water, and
whatever you want to become or to achieve as an ocean, that you can achieve only drop by
drop. So we thought of the app as a way to help you see how you are spending your drops
of attention, so you can make sure you are using them to build the ocean you want.

We tried to make it as simple as we could think of. You just have to define the categories
you want to track (work, YouTube, messaging, ...), and the app records the time you spend on each 
category. Then you can see the results on a few plots that give you a clearer
understanding on how you spent your time.

As soon as the App is on, you will see the Start Session button. The app will start recording
as you open it, but the sessions allow you to commit to an amount of time of your choice
and you will hear sounds that will let you know if you are on track or not to do what you
decided you wanted to do. 
The pie chart will start updating in real time. The edit icon will take you to the folder 
where the data is being saved, so you can use it for your own analysis. 
Notice that the data is only saved in your computer, and 
is never sent anywhere, for you to have full control on your data. 
In fact, the app does not even require internet connection.
The camera icon, will save the current pie
chart as a .png in the same folder. Instead, the update icon, will load the changes you have 
made in the tags_and_keywords.txt file, without having to restart the app. 

Notice that the App
reads the name of the window that is active, so, if you are reading a document and when you hover
on the icon with the mouse it says abc_123.pdf, and you consider that to be part of your work,
you can write .pdf or abc, if you consider that to be a better identifier,
in the tags_and_keywords.txt after the work tag.
